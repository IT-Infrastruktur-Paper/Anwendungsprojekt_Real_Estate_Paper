In order grasp the complexity and importance of the programming language JavaScript, it is necessary to get a basic understanding of it. Therefore ChatGPT has been asked to summarize the available resources on JavaScript with the following result:

"JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, interpreted programming language primarily utilized for client-side web development. It employs a prototype-based object-oriented paradigm, featuring first-class functions and asynchronous programming capabilities. JavaScript is commonly embedded within HTML documents and executed by web browsers to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) dynamically, enabling interactive user interfaces and dynamic content generation. Its versatility extends beyond web development, as it can also be employed for server-side scripting, mobile application development, and desktop application development through frameworks like Node.js. JavaScript's syntax is influenced by C and Java, offering a rich ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools for application development. It serves as a fundamental technology underpinning modern web applications, facilitating the creation of dynamic and interactive experiences across various platforms." (!Quelle/Prompt einf√ºgen!)
