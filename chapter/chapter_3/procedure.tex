The structure of the test cases was always the same. The respective test is started via a button, which opens a pop-up window in which the input for the test is entered. The input is then confirmed and the corresponding code is executed. The result is output via the command line and then recorded in a table.
We started the first test with the input 100000000 and ran the test ten times.
We started the second test with the input 100000000 and also ran it ten times.
We started the third test with the input 30000 and ran it five times.
In addition, we calculated the average runtime, the standard deviation and the factor by which WASM or JavaScript is executed faster than the other for all tests, with the latter referring to the average runtime.
