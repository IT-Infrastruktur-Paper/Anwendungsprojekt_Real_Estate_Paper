This paper aims to investigate the performance disparity between Web Assembly (WASM) and JavaScript (JavaScript) in the context of client-side applications, with a focus on computationally intensive algorithms. The objective is to determine whether WASM provides a distinct advantage over JavaScript in terms of efficiency through comprehensive experimentation and analysis.
