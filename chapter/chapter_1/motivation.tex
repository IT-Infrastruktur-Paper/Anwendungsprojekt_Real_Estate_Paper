The motivation of this study is to analyse, clarify and evaluate the performance of WebAssembly in comparison to JavaScript. The resulting findings are particularly interesting because this web standard is relatively new compared to JavaScript.
For this reason, we believe that it is important to continue researching this standard in depth in order to enable meaningful use and in-depth future development. In addition, we would like to gain a deeper understanding of the performance characteristics of WebAssembly in comparison to JavaScript. This requires both research into existing analyses and an independent analysis of the two web standards.
Overall, we would like to make a contribution to the performance discussion between WebAssembly and JavaScript with this work as part of a comprehensive analysis.
