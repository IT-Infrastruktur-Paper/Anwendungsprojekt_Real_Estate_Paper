In order to completely cover the most important topics and to have a clear outline for the research process, we defined the following research objectives:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Evaluate the performance of Web Assembly and JavaScript implementations in executing computationally intensive algorithms within client-side applications.
    \item Measure and compare CPU utilization between WASM and JavaScript implementations across various benchmark tests.
    \item Assess memory usage and management efficiency between WASM and JavaScript for tasks involving computationally intensive operations.
    \item Analyze the impact of DOM manipulation on the overall performance of WASM and JavaScript implementations within the context of client-side applications.
    \item Provide empirical evidence and insights to ascertain whether Web Assembly is advantageous over JavaScript from an efficiency perspective in the targeted application domain.
    \item Offer recommendations and guidelines for developers based on the findings to optimize performance when selecting between Web Assembly and JavaScript for client-side applications with computationally intensive algorithms.
\end{itemize}
